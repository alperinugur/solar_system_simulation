# Solar System Simulation ( Gravity with Python ) - Planets and astreoids.
This Python program simulates the movement of celestial bodies in a simplified model of the solar system using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Why did I do this?
Actually, the code will show how Jupiter and Saturn protects our world - The Earth, from astreoids and other celestial bodies. 
I was interested in three-body problem, and while looking at it, here I found myself creating a simulation of the solar system.

## Description

The simulation creates a window displaying the sun, planets, and asteroids, each represented by colored circles. The program calculates the gravitational forces between the celestial bodies and updates their positions accordingly.

## Installation

To run the simulation, you need Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/).

After installing Python, you can execute the `solar_system_simulation.py` script using any Python IDE or by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python solar_system_simulation.py
```

## Usage
Upon running the program, a window will open displaying the simulation. The celestial bodies will move according to their gravitational interactions. The simulation will continue until you close the window.

You can customize various parameters of the simulation by modifying the constants defined in the code, such as window dimensions, number of asteroids, and gravitational constants.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (included in standard Python installation)
